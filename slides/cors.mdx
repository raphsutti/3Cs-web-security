What is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

---

export default Layout;

<img src={require("file-loader!./images/cors-error.png")} />

- Cross origin requests normally blocked by browser
- CORS = Relaxation of the same origin policy
- Could introduce CSRF vulns

```notes
Those who worked with frontend server talking to backend server would run into this

The request normally blocked by the browser

Setting up CORS will let browsers get passed this error

origin: (domain, scheme, or port)
```

How does it work? - HTTP Headers

- Access-Control-Allow-Origin
- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials

```notes
Important HTTP headers

ACAO
ACAC
```

---

export default Layout;

<img src={require("file-loader!./images/cors1.jpg")} />

```notes
Access malicious site that redirects to fetch sensitive data that is in the server on the right
```

---

export default Layout;

<img src={require("file-loader!./images/cors2.jpg")} />

```notes
Browser adds Origin header as it is a cross origin request
```

---

export default Layout;

<img src={require("file-loader!./images/cors3.jpg")} />

```notes
Server checks Origin header and adds ACAO header and if origin is allowed
Server add ACAC if cookies are allowed to be forwarded
```

---

export default Layout;

<img src={require("file-loader!./images/cors4.jpg")} />

```notes
Browser forwards the request
(Would block if no ACAO header)
(Would not send cookies if no ACAD header)
```

---

export default Layout;

Unfortunately..

- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \*
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: null üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

```notes
ACAO headers do not allow list, it is one origin, all origin, or null

Interestingly you think null means you dont trust any origin.

But null origins are resources that use file:// schemes
```

---

export default Layout;

Fortunately..

- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \*
- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

```notes
As someone who just wants to get this working

You might want to allow every origins and send cookies through

Fortunately, this will result in an error
```

Misconfigured CORS example

- Reflect any origins in ACAO header
- Attacker could obtain sensitive info eg API keys

```notes
Developers might want to get around this * and true restriction by coding up the logic
```

export default LayoutNoFooter;

<CodeSurfer
  theme={nightOwl}
  language="javascript"
  code={`
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: (ctx) => 
      // reflecting whatever origin header is supplied üî•
      return ctx.request.header.origin; 
    credentials: true,
  })
);
`}
/>

```notes
Our server here is going to add ACAO headers based on what Origin header was supplied

This is bad
```

Attack: CORS reflecting any request origin header

http://vuln.hacker.com:2021/

http://127.0.0.1:9000/malicious-cors.html

```notes
3.1-cors.ts

The site currently only shows the balance of the logged in user
The site could should API keys
The server reflect origin as ACAO and forwards the page content
```

Dont worry pikachu this isnt too bad

Defence: CORS only reflect ACAO on trusted sites

```notes
3.1.r1-cors-acao.ts

Show blocked by CORS error in browser
```

export default LayoutNoFooter;

<CodeSurfer
  theme={nightOwl}
  language="javascript"
  code={`
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: (ctx) => {
      const suppliedOrigin = ctx.request.header.origin;
      const trustedSites = ["https://shipit.com", "https://trustedsite.com"];
      if (trustedSites.includes(suppliedOrigin)) {
        return suppliedOrigin; // Only allow trusted sites‚ú®
      }
      return false;
    },
    credentials: true,
  })
);
`}
/>

```notes
Our server only returns ACAO for trusted origins
```

---

export default Layout;

Confusing Origin: null

- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: null

```notes
Another confusing aspect of CORS is the null origin
When browser must send Origin header, it would be set to null
eg. iframe
```

---

export default Layout;

Defence against CORS misconfigurations

- Only allow trusted sites
  - Dynamically reflecting origins should be validated
- Avoid allowing ACAO: null
